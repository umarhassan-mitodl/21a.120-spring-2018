Course Description
------------------

The mythic idea of the “American Dream” – or the ability for all individuals and groups to “make it” through hard work and determination – has historically been at the center of U.S. national self-understandings. In class, we’ll discuss both the hopes and challenges wrapped up in ideas of the “American Dream” – including decreasing rates of mobility, growing inequality, and changing patterns of immigration in the United States in more recent years. The focus of this class, however, is on _storytelling_. We will use storytelling, as found in oral histories, memoirs, novels, or “auto-ethnographies,” to explore something Americans are often uncomfortable discussing - social class. Through this focus on storytelling, students will gain a deeper sense of how social class is experienced in people’s day-to-day lives as well as how it intersects with other dimensions of social experience like race, ethnicity, and gender. This class also puts an emphasis on _hands-on_ research projects and class assignments. Students will learn how to conduct oral histories and interviews. They will also work in groups to analyze “stories” found in the archival records of a community-based museum located in a formerly industrial region with a large immigrant population. These archival records include: primary documents, home movies, photos, and oral histories.
